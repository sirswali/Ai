## Gap Analysis

### 1. Data Processing Gaps

#### Real-Time Analytics
* **PoC Requirement:** 
  * Real-time feedback on system performance
  * Proactive assistance and task management
  * Predictive analytics for decision-making

* **Current Implementation:**
  ```python
  # No real-time analytics implementation for:
  - Performance monitoring
  - System health metrics
  - Usage patterns analysis
  ```

* **Impact:**
  * Limited ability to provide proactive insights
  * Reduced capability for real-time decision support
  * Missing performance optimization opportunities

#### Bias Management
* **PoC Requirement:**
  * Minimized bias in task allocation
  * Fair workload distribution
  * Unbiased decision-making support
