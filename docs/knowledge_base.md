# Knowledge Base

The Knowledge Base component is responsible for storing, retrieving, and managing information used by our multi-agent system. It serves as a central repository of knowledge that can be accessed and updated by various parts of the application.

## Key Features

1. **Information Storage**: Store structured and unstructured data.
2. **Efficient Retrieval**: Quick and accurate retrieval of relevant information.
3. **Dynamic Updates**: Ability to add, modify, and delete information in real-time.
4. **Metadata Management**: Track and manage metadata for stored information.

## Main Components

### KnowledgeBase Class

The `KnowledgeBase` class is the core of our knowledge management system. It provides methods to interact with the underlying storage system and manage the knowledge repository.

### Key Methods

- `add_entry`: Adds a new entry to the knowledge base.
- `get_entry`: Retrieves a specific entry from the knowledge base.
- `update_entry`: Updates an existing entry in the knowledge base.
- `delete_entry`: Removes an entry from the knowledge base.
- `search`: Searches the knowledge base for relevant information.
- `get_storage_info`: Retrieves information about the current state of the knowledge base storage.

## Usage

To use the Knowledge Base:

1. Ensure the storage configuration is properly set.
2. Initialize the KnowledgeBase object.
3. Use the object methods to interact with the knowledge base.

Example:

```python
kb = KnowledgeBase(config.KB_STORAGE_PATH)
kb.add_entry("unique_id", "This is a new piece of information", {"category": "general", "tags": ["example", "new"]})
result = kb.search("information")
```

## Configuration

The Knowledge Base requires the following configuration:

- `KB_STORAGE_PATH`: The path where the knowledge base data will be stored

This should be set in your environment variables or config file.

## Storage Backend

The current implementation uses a local file-based storage system. However, the KnowledgeBase class is designed to be extensible, allowing for easy integration with different backend storage solutions (e.g., databases, cloud storage) in the future.

## Future Improvements

- Implement advanced search capabilities using natural language processing
- Add support for storing and retrieving different types of data (text, images, etc.)
- Implement version control for knowledge base entries
- Add a caching layer for frequently accessed information
- Implement data validation and schema enforcement for entries
