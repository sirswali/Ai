# Slack Integration

The Slack integration component handles all interactions between our multi-agent system and Slack. It's responsible for processing Slack commands, sending messages, and managing the bot's presence in Slack channels.

## Key Features

1. **Command Handling**: Processes various slash commands for task management, knowledge base operations, and project management.
2. **Message Sending**: Sends formatted messages and updates to Slack channels or users.
3. **Event Listening**: Listens for relevant Slack events and triggers appropriate actions.

## Main Components

### SlackBot Class

The `SlackBot` class is the core of our Slack integration. It initializes the Slack app, sets up event listeners, and manages the bot's lifecycle.

### Command Handlers

Various handler functions are implemented to process different Slack commands. These include:

- Task Management: allocate_task, workload_report, reallocate_tasks, etc.
- Knowledge Base: kb_add, kb_search, kb_update, kb_delete, kb_info
- Project Management: sprint_planning, progress_report, bug_report, etc.

## Usage

To use the Slack integration:

1. Ensure the Slack API token is properly set in the configuration.
2. Initialize the SlackBot with necessary components.
3. Register the command handlers.
4. Start the bot.

Example:

```python
slack_bot = SlackBot(components, config.SLACK_BOT_TOKEN, config.SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET)
register_slack_handlers(slack_bot)
slack_bot.start()
```

## Configuration

The Slack integration requires the following configuration:

- `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`: The bot token for your Slack app
- `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET`: The signing secret for verifying requests from Slack

These should be set in your environment variables or config file.

## Future Improvements

- Implement interactive messages for more dynamic user interactions
- Add support for Slack's Block Kit for richer message formatting
- Implement OAuth flow for multi-workspace support
